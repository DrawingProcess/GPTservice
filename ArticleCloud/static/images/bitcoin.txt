bitcoin: a deterministic, tamper-proof digital currency. Unlike fiat currencies, which are defined by governments as redeemable in paper form only, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and there is no central authority with the power to decide when a transaction is complete. As a result, Bitcoin is immune to government-issued censorship and can therefore act as a truly anonymous monetary system.
Unlike national currencies, where national borders determine the price of imports, Bitcoin can determine the price of goods and services at any point in time. Because there is no need for any third party to arbitrate disputes, there is less concern about whether a transaction was actually successful than in the case of a dollar bill. Because there is no need for credit bureaus or charges to consumers, there is less need for middlemen, and companies can optimize their business by focusing on their own operations.
Although there have been many bankruptcies due to Bitcoin mining failures, the total number of Bitcoins is limited by the network’s protocol. There is no limit to the number of Bitcoins a single person may own, and once a Bitcoin is generated it is irreversible. This eliminates the risk of double spending, a problem tied to the fiat system’s monopoly on control of the currency. Because there is no clearing house or centralized authority to halt a transaction, there is no way for a thief to gain illegitimate access to Bitcoin.Finally, the power structure of Congress is also fundamentally different today than it was 20 years ago.
