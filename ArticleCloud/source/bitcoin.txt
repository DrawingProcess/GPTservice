bitcoin: The New York Times website published an article on Jan. 9 about a looming shortage of confidence in the currency. The article quoted Frommer, who said that Bitcoin was struggling because it had not received enough support from the general public.
“There are a lot of people who are skeptical right now,” Frommer said. “Even greater numbers when you look at the age of the population and the growth of the user base.”She added that she hoped her initiative would help dispel “the myths about Bitcoin, and the biggest one is the volatility.”
Volatility, she said, “is a product of the Bitcoin mining itself, not the lack of any other technology.”
That may be one reason why volatility has fallen so far back from its all-time high of more than $1,000 in 2014. Criticism of the Bitcoin network has grown, in part, because of concerns about the way it was used in China. Greece barred Bitcoin mining, and Malaysia restricted the use of its currency, Credit Suisse said.
“It’s not like there’s a large push to ban Bitcoin right now,” Ms. Morello said. “There’s more of a focus on its use in criminal activity,” she said, and less focus on its price.
But Bitcoin still has supporters, like the Bitcoin Association, which was founded in 2013 in the United States
